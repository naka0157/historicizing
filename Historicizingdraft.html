	 <p> <h3>History</h3>

		Figure and figurecaption are two elements that were introduced in HTML5. Figure is 
		used to reference something in the article for example images, graphs, videos, 
		diagrams, e.tc. Figurecaption goes hand in hand with figure element. Every time 
		the figure element is used anywhere; a figurecaption with an explanation of the 
		figure should always follow.
    	</div>
   
	</p>
					<div class="col-sm-6" style="background-color:lavenderblush;">
					
				<p><h3>Exigence</h3>

	   Was there a need for the introduction of the figure and figurecaption element? 
	   Why can’t we just stick to img, and use text to explain the element? 
	   Every time the figure element is used, there must also be a figurecaption. 
	   Some of the images/figures are self-explanatory. Is there a need to have a 
	   caption every single time?

		<h3>How it works</h3>

<figure>
 <img src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.digitaltutors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tea_mouse.jpg?zoom=2&resize=800%2C533" alt="Tea cup with steam and pen on bed" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; width:600px; height:333px;">
 <figcaption>Journaling with Tea</figcaption>
</figure>
	<p>
	Above is an example of how to use the figure and figcaption. As noted in the history, 
	figure element can be used to reference different things like images (as seen above),
 	graphs, etc. A caption usually follows every time the figure element is introduced. 
 	There should only be one figurecaption in the figure block.

<h3>Figure vs Img tags </h3>

	Images are linked to HTML pages. The img tag creates a holding space for the 
	referenced image. If removed from where it was placed, it affects the flow of 
	the document. Content of figure element is related to the main flow. 
	It’s position is independent the main flow. If removed from anywhere, 
	it shouldn’t affect the flow of the article. Before the introduction of the figure,
	there was no way of adding caption to an image. The only way one could add a caption
	was by writing a paragraph explaining what the figure represents. But with the 
	introduction of figure element, it also came with the figure caption where people 
	can add a little explanation about the figure. 


	Img is one of the things that go inside the figure. Therefore, the img was not 
	completely replaced. It comes with the figure and enables the designer to do 
	different things. Figure allows the designer to add other things like audio files, 
	code, and graphs to the pages. 

<h3> Figurecaption vs text explanation </h3>
	<p>
	Figurecaption comes after the figure element is used. It enables the designer to 
	add an brief explanation of whatever figure is introduced without necessarily 
	writing a paragraph to explain something. 

	Text explanation is something was suggested where every time someone used img tag 
	and wanted to explain what it meant, they started a paragraph and wrote something 
	about it.
