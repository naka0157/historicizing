  		<h1>Figure and Figurecaption in HTML5</h1>
	 	<p>
		   <h3>History</h3>

			With the introduction of HTML5, it also brought about new tags, and some old tags
			that were made better to help in the organization of the articles and to make
			pages look better. The introduction of the new tags brought some changes to
			different things that most people were used to. Some of the new tags introduced
			were, hgroup, header and footer, navigation, aside, and figure and figure
			caption, et.c. There is a sense of new versus old technology with the
			introduction of the new HTML5 tags that most people that use HTML were not
			used to. The focus of this article is to explain the way figure and figure
			caption came about, and how they affected the way people use them.

			Figure and figure caption are two elements that were introduced in HTML5.
			Figure is used to reference something in the article for example images, graphs,
			videos, diagrams, e.tc. Figure Caption goes hand in hand with figure element.
			Every time the figure element is used anywhere, a figure caption with an
			explanation of the figure should always follow.

		   <h3>Exigence</h3>

	  	Figure and figure caption in a way contribute to the discussion of the new vs
	  	old technologies. In this case the figure and figure caption would be the new
	  	technology, and the image tag would be the old technology. In one of the articles
	  	we discussed in this class that was written by Haas, there was the discussion of
	  	whether either one of the technologies was better than the other in terms of
	  	workplaces. The same argument can be applied to the way figure and figure caption
	  	affected the way people added things like images to articles. Most people have had
	  	conflicting views about the introduction of figure and figure caption tags. In
	  	the article she says “... more advanced technologies are not necessarily the
	  	powerful technologies…” (Haas pg. 225) Therefore, it is important to understand
	  	that although figure and figure caption were introduced, it doesn’t automatically
	  	mean that they are more powerful than the image tag that was used in previous
	  	HTML versions. Hence, a few questions were raised to help us understand whether
	  	the figure and figure caption were really beyond just making the code look good
	  	and having better semantics. Some of the questions raised were; Was there a need
	  	for the introduction of the figure and figurecaption element? Why can’t we just
	  	stick to img, and use text to explain the element? Every time the figure element
	  	is used, there must also be a figurecaption. Some of the images/figures are self
	  	explanatory. Is there a need to have a caption every single time? These questions
	  	will be answered in the blocks below.

	           <h3>How it works</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src=" ">
 					<figcaption>Lake Victoria Serena Hotel Uganda</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>

		Above is an example of how to use the figure and figcaption. I got the example
		from the digital tutors blog. I could have used different examples, but this one
		in particular was simple enough and helped to illustrate the figure and figure
		caption in a very simple way. As noted in the history, figure element can be used
		to reference different things like images (as seen above), graphs, etc. A caption
		usually follows every time the figure element is introduced. In previous versions
		of HTML, people usually just wrote the line that starts with img .... without
		introducing the figure element. The image would sometimes be followed with a
		paragraph explaining what the image represents. For example below is how I
		would write the same code without the figure and figure caption tags.

			 <div class = “Image>
				  <img src=" ">
					 <p> Lake Victoria Serena Hotel Uganda </p>
			  </div>

		In terms of semantics, the code with the figure and figure captions looks a lot
		better than the one with out them. “figure is a semantic way of grouping all
		things you will need for an image together. Instead of nesting an image and a
		caption you’ve put in a paragraph within a div with a class of “image” or something
		similar, you can group all image like things together in figure” (Digital Tutors blog)
		Figure helps us to have less tags and more readable code. There is no need to
		explicitly state the class for whatever we are using, and to introduce a paragraph
		to talk about the image. All this information can be done by just using the figure tag.

		It is important to note that there should only be one figure caption in the figure
		block. Therefore, if more than one image is used in the figure block, the figure
		caption should use things like “fig 1, fig 2, et.c” to talk about each image.

		   <h3>Figure vs Img tags </h3>

		Before exploring the differences between figure element and image tags, it is
		important to note that “the figure and image tags are not interchangeable.”
		(Blog from Digital Tutors website) This simply means that you cannot opt to use
		one in the place of the other. The blog also goes on to say “images tags are still
		absolutely necessary in HTML, the figure tag is really just a different way to
		organize the content.” This helped to answer one of the questions I had about why
		we can’t just stick to the image tag instead of introducing the figure tag. Figure
		did not replace the image tag, it just brought better ways the images can be
		organized in the article. In other words figure helps in cases where one might
		need to use more than one image in article in different places.

		Images are linked to HTML pages. The img tag creates a holding space for the
		image. If removed from where it was placed, it affects the flow of
		the document. In the stackoverflow discussion, someone explained it better by
		stating that, “Images are not technically inserted into an HTML page, images are
		linked to the HTML page.”(Stackoverflow discussion). Therefore, the image tag is
		really used to link an image to an HTML page.

		Content of figure element is related to the main flow. It’s position is independent
		from the main flow. If removed from anywhere, it shouldn’t affect the flow of the
		article. Duckett states that “It is important to note that the article should still
		make sense if the content were moved (to another part of the page, or even to a
		different page altogether). (Duckett Pg. 439) Therefore, what this means is that
		although the position of the figure element is independent, it is important for the
		element to have some meaning wherever it is used in the article.

		Img is one of the things that go inside the figure. Therefore, the img was not
		completely replaced. It comes with the figure and enables the designer to do
		different things.


		Figure allows the designer to add other things like audio files, code, and graphs
		to the pages. Therefore, “figure element represents self contained content…”
		(Mozilla developer website). The self contained content could range from things
		like audio files, code, and graphs to pages. This makes it different from the image
		because that content can now be independent from other things in the HTML page.

		</p>
		    <h3> Figurecaption vs text explanation </h3>

		<p>

		Figure Caption “represents a caption or legend for the contents of its parent figure
		element” (W3C website) . It enables the designer to add a brief explanation of
		whatever figure is introduced without necessarily writing a paragraph to explain
		something. “In traditional printed material like books, and magazines an image,
		chart, or code example would be accompanied by a caption. Before now, we didn’t
		have a way of semantically marking this content directly in our HTML, instead
		resorting to CSS class names…” (HTML5 Doctor website). With the introduction of
		the figure caption in HTML5, this problem has been solved. We can now have a caption
		the way other print sources like books would have captions. This helps to answer the
		question of why there was a need to introduce figure and figure caption. The caption
		helped bridge the gap that existed between other print medias, and the HTML pages.
		Both now have the ability to use caption without looking drastically different.
		Therefore, HTML pages can now look like books, and magazines by using captions too.

		For the question phrased about whether it is necessary to use the figure caption
		each time, the same article explains that, “the figcaption element is optional
		and can appear before or after the content of the figure” (HTML5 Doctor website).
		There is no need to have a caption after every image. However, I think although it
		is not completely necessary to have a caption after every figure, for good practice
		(especially academic purposes). it is a good idea to have the caption every time the
		figure caption is used.

		Text explanation is something that was suggested where every time someone used
		img tag and wanted to explain what it meant, they started a paragraph and wrote
		something about it. This is quite different from how other print medias would
		add text to an image.

		    <h3> Conclusion </h3>

		From all the information collected about the figure and figure caption,
		it is evident that the two tags are necessary. They help people to do things
		that were not possible before. For example adding captions to images, graphs,
		et.c.
